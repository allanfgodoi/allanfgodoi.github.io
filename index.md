## 👨 About Me

I am Allan Eduardo Flores Godoi Ferreira, born in Brazil and currently an undergraduate physics student at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). I am part of the university CMS Collaboration Experimental Group (GECMS-UFRGS) and from the Particle Analysis and Simulation Group (GASP-UFRGS), and also collaborate with the São Paulo Research and Analysis Center (SPRACE-UNESP). My research projects are related to Experimental Heavy-ion Physics and Machine Learning applied to Experimental High Energy Physics.
